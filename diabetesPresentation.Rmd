# History
## Diabetes
- Symptoms of Diabetes mellitus were first described 3000 years ago by the Egyptians. 
- The term "Diabetes" was first coined by Araetus of Cappodocia (81-133AD), a Greek physician which literally means "a passer through; a siphon" but with the intention of meaning excessive urination. 
- The word "diabetes" is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425.
- The word mellitus (honey sweet) was added by Thomas Willis (Britain) in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients - The sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians.....
- It was only in 1776 that Dobson (Britain) firstly confirmed the presence of excess sugar in urine and blood as a cause of their sweetness. 
- The term "Diabetes mellitus" essentially means sweet excessive urination.
## Insulin
- It was initially discovered in 1920 after nearly 60 years of studying the metabolic purpose of the pancreas in dogs. in 1889 when the pancreas of a dog was removed and flies were observed feeding on the dogs urine.
