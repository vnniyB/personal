# History

## Diabetes
- Symptoms of Diabetes mellitus were first described 3000 years ago by the Egyptians. 
- The term "Diabetes" was first coined by Araetus of Cappodocia (81-133AD), a Greek physician which literally means "a passer through; a siphon" but with the intention of meaning excessive urination. 
- The word "diabetes" is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425.
- The word mellitus (honey sweet) was added by Thomas Willis (Britain) in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients - The sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians.....
- It was only in 1776 that Dobson (Britain) firstly confirmed the presence of excess sugar in urine and blood as a cause of their sweetness. 
- The term "Diabetes mellitus" essentially means sweet excessive urination.

## Insulin
- 1889 the pancreas of a dog was removed and flies were observed feeding on the dogs urine.
- 1920 At this time the only way to control diabetes was to have a diet low in cabohydrate and sugar, and high in protein and fat. Instead of dying shortly after diagonosis, This would allow diabetics to live for roughly a year.
- 1921 Fluid from the pancreas of healthy dogs was injected into dogs with their pancreas removed. Restoring the dogs to a healthy state.
- 1922 A relively pure form of insulin was extracted from the pancreas of cattle from slaughterhouses and injected into a diabetic teenager in Toronto hospital. Whose health improved dramatically.
- 1923 Banting and Macleod recieved the Nobel Prize in medicine for this work. The university of Toronoto gave pharmaceutical companies licence to produce insulin free of royalties.
- 1924 Insulin became widely available around the world.
- 1926 Insulin is one of the first proteins to have its structure studied via Xray crytallography.
- 1955 Insulin becomes the first protein to be fully sequenced by Frederick Sanger.

## What is Insulin?

- Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cell in the pancreas of animals.
- It regulates blood sugar by promoting absorption of glucose from the blood stream into muscles, organs and fat tissue.
